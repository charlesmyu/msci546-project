    "# Parsing Census Data\n",
    "The goal of this file is to parse data from census tables into an intermediate format so we can merge them into a master table later. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. Duplicate the folder (i.e. `S2301`) within `census-data`, and rename the folder to the name of the Census table you are processing\n",
    "2. Empty the `raw` folder\n",
    "3. Download census data and place into `raw`. Each year of data should be in its own csv file. Rename each file into `<year>.csv`\n",
    "4. Update the transformation in the code block below to obtain the desired columns, and rename them if necessary\n",
    "    - For most tables, you will only need to lookup the column code of the feature you are looking to obtain, and match that to a readable name in `features`\n",
    "5. Verify the transformation is correct using the `df.head()` statement already placed there for you. If it looks good, the data is good!"
